## Workshop & Training

I've authored comprehensive observability training workshops used by engineering teams:

- **OpenTelemetry Workshop** - Hands-on instrumentation labs covering auto-instrumentation, manual tracing, metrics, and collector configuration
- **Coralogix Observability Workshop** - End-to-end observability including log aggregation, metric collection, APM, and alert configuration

These workshops help teams transition to modern observability practices with distributed tracing and telemetry standards.

## Areas of Interest
